Scala is a powerful programming language that powers Spark. I want to develop expertise in Scala, improve my overall CS/programming skill set
and begin writing production code in the language.


[HERE](https://github.com/tomscolaro/Scala_Implementations/ "Project Repo") is repository for the project. 

My hope to push commits to this repository on a weekly basis.
