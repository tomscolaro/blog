<p>  I grew up being a real math guy. Then I went to college, got into business school and figured that
  I had left that life behind. When I decided on majoring in economics and analytics, it gave me the chance to use
   math and stats to get to the "right" decision. And I haven't looked back since.
</p>

<p>
  I wandered into some python tutorials, and taught myself to code. Naturally, as I progressed in skill, I got further
  into pure software development and guts of the models I was using. I can say that I am fortunate enough that I get paid
  to do what I enjoy. While most of my work currently fits more into data science, I am always looking to
  build cool stuff, so general software/web development interests me as well.
</p>
<p>
  In my free time I enjoy powerlifting, drinking craft beer and fantasy sports. I'm also a self-professed pizza snob. (hmu on twitter if you have recommendations)
