<p>  I grew up being an inventor. This grand idea of creating and building new and innovative things was something, even as child, I always aspired for.
    After falling in love with math, machine learning, and development, it became obvious that its a path I should persue.
</p>

<p>
  I wandered into some python tutorials and taught myself to code. Naturally, as I progressed in skill, I got further
  into pure software development and guts (so to speak) of the models I was using. While most of my work currently fits more into data science, I am a builder.
  So I am always looking to build cool stuff.
