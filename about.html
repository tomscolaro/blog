<p>  Hi, I'm Tom. I'm a data scientist with a passion for quantifying and remedying problems with technology, math, and story telling. 
  Occasionally, I make Youtube videos on things that I find interesting in ML. 
</p>

<p>My background in economics and computer science, which means that I am really fun at parties.
