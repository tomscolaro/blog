<p>  Hi, I'm Tom. I'm a data scientist with a passion for quantifying and remedying problems with techonology, math, and story telling. 
  Occasionally, I make Youtube videos, on things that I am learning or informationals on important topics. I'm currently interested in and 
  researching deep learning for recommendation systems and quantifying risk in ambiguous situations 
</p>

<p>My background in economics and statistics, which means that I am really fun at parties. 
  It's my goal to continue to have a positive effect on the world through my work, and to change people's lives for the better. 
</p>
