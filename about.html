<p>  I grew up wanting to be an inventor. This grand idea of creating something new and innovative was something I always aspired for, even as a child.
  I specifically remember disassembling old toys, and rebuilding them into new franken-toys (sorry, Mom and Dad) and imagining a larger than life story for them.
    After falling in love with math, machine learning, and development, it became obvious that it was my path.
</p>

<p>
  I wandered into some python tutorials and taught myself to code. Naturally, as I progressed in skill, I got further
  into pure software development and the guts (so to speak) of the models I was using. While most of my work currently fits more into the data science category, I am a builder.
  I am always looking to build cool stuff, regardless of the discipline.
